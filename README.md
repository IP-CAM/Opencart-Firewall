# BB-Firewall

I put this htaccess and deny.php scripts together to make it simple to deny a user access to the website you are hosting. This script will allow you to quickly entern and ip4 or ip6 address and it will automaticly add the domain with it.

I am working on adding a filter to find duplicates also. 

Great to use with wordpress or opencart.
